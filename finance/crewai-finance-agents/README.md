# CrewAI Finance Agents - Proof of Concept Applications

This repository houses a collection of Proof of Concept (POC) applications demonstrating the power and flexibility of the [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) framework in tackling various financial tasks. Each application within the `src` directory explores specific use cases, showcasing how intelligent agents can collaborate to analyze data, generate insights, and automate workflows within the finance domain.
